# GoogleDriveSyncBlock
> GoogleDriveSyncBlock is an app that recognizes when Visual Studio is running and kills google drive sync . If visual Studio is not running, the program automatically restarts Google Drive Sync.

To avoid problems, delete Google Drive Sync from the ausautostart and replace it with GoogleDriveSyncBlock.exe

You can do what ever you want with this project.
Have fun!
